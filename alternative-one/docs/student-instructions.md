   - Test edge cases early
   - Choose advanced features wisely

## Development Tips

### 1. Focus on Core Features First
- ✅ Data loading and display
- ✅ Basic table structure
- ✅ Simple sorting
- ✅ Name filtering

### 2. Test Edge Cases Early
- Null companions
- Empty cast arrays
- Special characters
- Different date formats

### 3. Effective AI Usage
- Ask for explanations, not just code
- Verify generated code works
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Understand the code you use

### 4. Common Pitfalls
- ❌ Not testing with real data
- ❌ Ignoring error handling
- ❌ Leaving console errors
- ❌ Untested edge cases

## Testing Your Solution

### Basic Functionality
1. Data loads without errors
2. Table displays correctly
3. Sorting works on all columns
4. Filtering updates results

### Edge Cases
1. Load the test data file
2. Try filtering special characters
3. Sort dates and numbers
4. Check null value handling

### Performance
1. Table remains responsive
2. Filters update smoothly
3. Sorting is efficient
4. No UI freezing

## Grading Philosophy
